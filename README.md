# NASGA
NASGA is North American Scottish Games Athletics, one of the primary databases and and organizations that govern Scottish Highland Games across Canada and the USA.  This application is a reimagined and modernized spin on the existing NASGA website/database that has been one of the primary sources of information about Scottish heritage competitions since 1998.

I built this project as an enthusiast and competitor in this fringe sport.  The existing version is perfectly functional and meticulously updated, but for a project I thought it would be an exciting to demonstrate how I would update the styling that hasn't been touched in over two decades.

## Getting Started:
Heroku Deployment: 
<https://nasga.herokuapp.com/>

Trello Board: 
<https://trello.com/b/qVWZ2TJB/nasga>

The user is free to explore te website without login authentication.  NASGA is meant to be an inormative website for educate visitors about Scottish athletics and history, then assist them in finding events.  To add more events to the database, or to edit the details of existing events, a visitor must login or register as an organizer.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- Django
- Python
- PostgreSQL

## Next Steps/Features:
- Allow registration of additional visitors as "competitors" and not only organizors.

- Competitors will be able to add themselves to an event, and to have the event displayed on a user profile to keep track of events they compete in, or plan to in the future.

- Organizers will be able to upload competition results to evenbts that have passed, and those results will also reflect on the profiles of the respective competitors.
  
- Implement search functionality so that visitors can find events based on location and date.
  
- The application needs to be responsive to mobile use.

## Lessons Learned:
This project was an excercise in working with limitations.  The goal was to keep the application simple, from user experience, functionality, and to the code itself.  This simplicity being inspired by the inherent limitations and speed of creating an application through Django, and the simple syntax of Python as a language.  I have learned from past projects that goig too elaborate with initial vision can waste time and allow myself to dig a hole that's hard to escape from with respect to deadlines.  It makes more sense to have a finished product, and to add features as needed.  The beauty of working with Django is being able to get things flowing more quickly, and trudging through implementing unnecessary icebox features early in the game is getting away from those advantages of Django.
